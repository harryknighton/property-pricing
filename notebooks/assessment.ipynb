By combining this data with the UK Office for National Statistics data on the latitude/longitude of postcodes (available [here](https://www.getthedata.com/open-postcode-geo)) you will have a record of house prices and their approximate latitude/longitude. Due to the size of these data you will use a relational database to handle them.  \n",

This means we can select that region and time period and build the joined data only from the relevent rows from the two tables. This will save time on the join.\n",

If it's very often, it would likely be better to store the entired database joined, because the one-off cost for that join is amortised across all the future predictions. If only a few predictions are required (like in our lab class) then doing that join on the fly might be better. In that case you can make use of an  *inner join* for this data set creation.\n",

We expect that knowledge of the local region around the property should be helpful in making those price predictions. To evaluate this we will now look at [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) as a data source.\n",

Using what you have learned about the `osmx` interface in the lectures, write general code for downloading points of interest and other relevant information that you believe may be useful for predicting house prices. Remembering the perspectives we've taken on *data science as debugging*, the remarks we've made when discussing *the data crisis* of the importance of reusability in data analysis, and the techniques we've explored in the labsessions for visualising features and exploring their correlation use the notebook to document your assessment of the OpenStreetMap data as a potential source of data.\n",
